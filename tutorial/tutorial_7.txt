-- Finally, <orange> spaces... They will make you taste like disgusting oranges!
-- For some reason fish love oranges and if you taste like one, they might bite you when you step on blue spaces.

# Orange spaces will make you orange-flavored. You cannot cross blue spaces if you are orange-flavored. Purple spaces will remove the orange flavor.
